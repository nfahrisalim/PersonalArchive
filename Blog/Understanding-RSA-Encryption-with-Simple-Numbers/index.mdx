# Understanding RSA Encryption with Simple Numbers

When we talk about today’s increasingly connected digital world, information security becomes a top priority. One of the most widely used methods for protecting sensitive data is the **RSA algorithm**. Although it might sound complex, it can actually be understood step by step.

## What is the RSA Algorithm?

RSA stands for **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman**, the inventors of the algorithm. It is a form of **public-key cryptography** that is widely used around the world. RSA secures messages or data by encrypting them with a **public key** (which can be shared with anyone). Only the **private key** holder can decrypt the data, and vice versa.

## How Does RSA Work?

RSA key generation starts with two prime numbers.

Take small primes for example

- p = 3  
- q = 7  

### Step 1: Calculate the Modulus

```
N = p * q
N = 3 * 7
N = 21
```

### Step 2: Calculate Euler’s Totient (φ)

```
r = (p-1) * (q-1)
r = (3-1) * (7-1)
r = 12
```

### Step 3: Choose e such that gcd(e, r) = 1

We need numbers where (e * d) mod r = 1. Some candidates are

```
13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, 169, 181,
193, 205, 217, 229, 241, 253, 265, 277, 289, 301, 313, 325, 337,
349, 361
```

From these, I pick 85 as an example (85 = 5 × 17). That gives me

- e = 5  
- d = 17  

So the keys are

- Private key = (21, 5)  
- Public key = (21, 17)

### Step 4: Encryption

Encrypting message M = 4 (must be less than N)

```
Cipher = (M^e) mod N
Cipher = (4^5) mod 21
Cipher = 16
```

The encrypted value of 4 with the private key (21, 5) is 16.

### Step 5: Decryption

```
Message = (Cipher^d) mod N
Message = (16^17) mod 21
Message = 4
```

And I get back the original number 4.

### Example With a Word

RSA works on numbers, so to encrypt a word like **Makassar**, each character is converted to its ASCII code. For example:

```
M = 77
A = 65
K = 75
A = 65
S = 83
S = 83
A = 65
R = 82
```

Each number is then encrypted using the key pair. With the toy keys (21, 5) and (21, 17):

```
77 mod 21 = 14  → Cipher = (14^5) mod 21 = 11 → Decrypt = (11^17) mod 21 = 14 → Back to 77 (M)
65 mod 21 = 2   → Cipher = (2^5) mod 21 = 11  → Decrypt = (11^17) mod 21 = 2  → Back to 65 (A)
75 mod 21 = 12  → Cipher = (12^5) mod 21 = 18 → Decrypt = (18^17) mod 21 = 12 → Back to 75 (K)
...
```

Doing this for every letter will eventually reconstruct the full word **Makassar**. 

This demonstrates that RSA can encrypt and then decrypt both numbers and text, as long as the message is first expressed in numerical form.

With this step-by-step breakdown, RSA becomes less of a mystery and more of a clear process that turns prime numbers into a working encryption system.
