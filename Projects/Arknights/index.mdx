# Arknights

This university project was created to fulfill web development course requirements and represents one of my first projects when learning web development. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the project attempts to recreate elements of the Arknights game website as a learning exercise in modern web development techniques.

The most enjoyable part of this project was implementing the gallery component, where I successfully managed to replicate the grid layout system. This grid implementation became a personal achievement as I learned to work with CSS Grid and Bootstrap integration, creating a responsive display that maintained visual appeal across different screen sizes. The gallery component represents my favorite aspect of the project, demonstrating early progress in mastering layout techniques.

As one of my initial web development projects, this work showcases the learning process of frontend development fundamentals including responsive design principles, JavaScript interactivity, and CSS styling. The project served as valuable hands-on experience in translating visual designs into functional web components while meeting academic requirements.

This early project highlights the learning journey in web development and the satisfaction of successfully implementing complex UI patterns during the initial stages of studying frontend technologies.

## ðŸ§° Technology Stack

Developed using semantic HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling and animations, and vanilla JavaScript for interactive functionality. The project leverages Bootstrap framework for responsive grid systems and component styling, with custom CSS overrides to match the original Arknights aesthetic perfectly.
