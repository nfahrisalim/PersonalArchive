IstirahatKi is an Android application designed to help users build healthy habits for hydration and adequate sleep. Born from a developer's personal struggle with forgetting to drink water and sleeping late due to work demands, this app combines a dual tracking system with gamification to boost user motivation.

The application features a clean, user-friendly interface that encourages users to maintain life balance through gamified habit tracking. It provides a unified dashboard for monitoring both water intake and sleep patterns, complete with smart analytics, weekly statistics visualization, and intelligent notifications that remind users to drink water regularly.

Built with MVVM architecture and Material Design 3, the app offers dark/light mode support, haptic feedback, and a comprehensive gamification system with XP points and leaderboard functionality. This makes it an ideal solution for busy office workers, developers, and health enthusiasts who struggle with maintaining healthy habits due to demanding schedules.
