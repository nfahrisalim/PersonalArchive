# KomDetek 

KomDetek is a Streamlit web application that detects bullying in TikTok comments using machine learning. The app analyzes Indonesian text through advanced NLP preprocessing and provides real-time classification results using four different ML models: SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and LSTM neural networks.

The application supports both individual comment analysis and bulk processing via CSV upload, making it suitable for researchers and content moderators. It features interactive visualizations with pie charts and classification tables to present detection results clearly. Built with IndoNLP and Sastrawi for Indonesian text processing, KomDetek ensures accurate analysis of local TikTok content and serves as a practical tool for combating cyberbullying on social media platforms.
