# Narasi

Narasi is a comprehensive JavaFX desktop application designed specifically for university students to publish, manage, and share their literary works including short stories, novels, and poetry. The platform addresses the common challenge students face in finding appropriate venues to express and distribute their creative writing while providing essential features for work management and reader interaction.

Built with object-oriented programming principles, the application implements a complete user authentication system, advanced search and filtering capabilities, and comprehensive work management tools. Students can publish their works with tagging systems, draft functionality, and content warnings, while readers can browse anonymously or create accounts to interact through likes and comments.

The platform features a modern JavaFX interface with multiple views including reading interface, comment system, publishing tools, and account management. The application uses SQLite for local database storage and implements proper OOP design patterns including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism throughout its architecture.

Narasi serves as a digital literary community where students can develop their writing skills, receive feedback from peers, and build their portfolio of creative works in a supportive academic environment.
