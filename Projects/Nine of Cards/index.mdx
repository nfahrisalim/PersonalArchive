# 🎴 Nine Cards Game

A nostalgic memory-matching game built with **Svelte**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite** — perfect for beginners exploring modern frontend tools.

## 📝 Description

**Nine Cards Game** is a simple yet engaging web game that showcases the use of **Svelte** as a frontend framework, enhanced with **TypeScript** for type safety and **Vite** for a blazing-fast development environment. The visual aesthetic combines **Tailwind CSS** with **nes.css**, evoking a retro gaming feel.

This project is designed to be both fun and educational — ideal for those who want to learn modern web development while building a playable game. The game features fast development with Vite's instant server startups and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), type-safe codebase using TypeScript for fewer bugs and better developer experience, stylized UI built with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with nes.css for classic game visuals, reactive state management using Svelte's built-in stores for smooth state handling, and a playable matching game where you flip cards, match pairs, and win.

### 🕹 Gameplay Instructions

You will see a 3x3 grid with **nine cards**. Click on a card to flip it and reveal what's behind. Click a second card: if it matches the first, both remain flipped; if not, both flip back over. Repeat until all pairs are matched. You win when all cards are matched and remain face up!
