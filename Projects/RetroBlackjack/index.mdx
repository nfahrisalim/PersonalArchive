# RetroBlackjack

RetroBlackjack is a classic blackjack card game wrapped in a nostalgic retro design aesthetic. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this web-based game delivers authentic blackjack gameplay with a charming vintage visual style that evokes the golden age of casino gaming.

The game features a comprehensive betting system where players start with $5000 and must place minimum bets of $100 before each hand. Following traditional blackjack rules, players compete against the dealer to reach 21 without going over, with winning hands earning double the bet amount while losses result in forfeited stakes. The game implements proper card deck management ensuring no duplicate cards appear during gameplay.

Built with vanilla JavaScript for game logic and CSS for the retro styling, RetroBlackjack demonstrates solid understanding of game development fundamentals including state management, random card distribution, and user interface design. The retro aesthetic combines classic typography, vintage color schemes, and period-appropriate visual elements to create an immersive nostalgic gaming experience.

This project showcases both technical programming skills and design sensibility, creating an engaging web game that balances authentic gameplay mechanics with appealing visual presentation.

## ðŸ§° Technology Stack

Developed using HTML5 for game structure, CSS3 for retro styling and animations, and vanilla JavaScript for game logic implementation. The project features custom card deck algorithms, betting system mechanics, and responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility.
