SAPA is a modern Android application that bridges citizens and authorities for reporting public issues with real-time Firebase integration. The app allows users to report various problems such as potholes, floods, and public facility issues directly from their smartphones, creating a direct communication channel between the community and local authorities.

Built with Firebase backend, the application features secure user authentication, advanced reporting capabilities with photo attachments and danger level indicators, and accurate location services using both automatic GPS detection and Google Places API for manual location search. The app provides real-time report display on the homepage, comprehensive profile management with the ability to view submitted reports and update profile pictures, and modern UI elements including loading indicators and pull-to-refresh functionality.

The application also includes offline mode support with emergency data loading from local files when internet connectivity is unavailable, making it reliable for critical reporting situations. This makes SAPA an essential tool for civic engagement and community problem-solving.
